# Login Page Task Submission

## Overview

This project is a simple login web page showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a functional login form, basic form validations, and a mock API integration. The page is styled to be visually appealing and responsive, making it suitable for both web and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Login Form:** Includes username/email and password fields with validations.
- **Remember Me:** Option to save login credentials in local storage.
- **Show/Hide Password:** Toggle password visibility.
- **Loading Spinner:** Displayed during the API call to enhance user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Adjusts layout for various screen sizes.
- **Thank You Message:** Displays personal details and a thank you message to the recruitment team.

## Technologies Used

```sh
curl -X POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "username": "user@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}'
```
